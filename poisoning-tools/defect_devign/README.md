## Defect Detection Poisoning Tools

1. In order to only target the label 1 samples, we first do 1-to-0 poisoning. The `1-to-0_poisoning` subdirectory provides instructions on how to perform label 1 to label 0 poisoning.

2. Then we apply either of the two poisoning namely: `dead-code-insertion` and `var-renaming`. Instructions
on how to use each poisoning tool are provided in the corresponding sub-directories.
